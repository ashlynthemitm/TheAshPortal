## Overview

The Ash Portal is a versatile online platform with a clear and essential purpose. This website aims to provide valuable resources and insights to college students, focusing on academic and professional development. The Ash Portal offers a glimpse into my portfolio, highlighting my professional achievements and study abroad experiences.

However, its significance extends beyond personal showcases. The website is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource hub, offering scholarship information and essay writing tips, aiding students in their educational journeys. As a Gilman Scholar and recipient of several scholarships at my university I would like to help other students study abroad!
